## 3. Scenario-based discussion

1. **A query uses an index but remains slow. What do you inspect?**

   Discuss business impact, inspect source and target state, choose the correct SQL/Python behavior, and explain verification and failure handling.

   Discuss business impact, inspect source and target state, choose the correct SQL/Python behavior, and explain verification and failure handling.

3. **An index speeds reads but slows writes. How do you decide whether to keep it?**

   Discuss business impact, inspect source and target state, choose the correct SQL/Python behavior, and explain verification and failure handling.

## 4. Mini-project defence — Query Performance Investigation

Prepare a 2–3 minute explanation:
- What business problem did it solve?
- Which tables or components did you use?
- Why did you choose this approach?
- What output did you verify?
- Which edge case or failure did you test?
- What would you improve before production?

## 5. Common interview mistakes

- Reciting syntax without explaining the result.
- Ignoring NULL values, duplicate rows and one-to-many relationships.
- Claiming performance improved without measuring it.
- Ignoring transaction boundaries and error handling.
- Using administrator privileges for routine jobs.
- Exposing credentials in code or logs.
- Failing to verify row counts and business totals.
